# Commit

Commit is a [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) site template built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting started

To get started, first install dependencies via npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env` file in the root of your project and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE` environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=example
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

### Project structure

The template is built as a pretty standard Next.js website, but using the `src` folder so things like the `app` directory are located at `./src/app` instead of being top-level.

### Title and metadata

You can update your site's metadata in `./src/app/layout.jsx`.

### Hero content

The main hero section for the site that includes your logo, headline, description, and links are all located in `./src/components/Intro.jsx`.
